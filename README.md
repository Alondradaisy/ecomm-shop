There are two main pages:

**1. Home Page**

**2. Shopping Bag page**

The store is organized to cater to user store shopping functionalities. A user has access to images of the items on card for easy access on a card, ability to add an item to a shopping bag, stores a bag with items that were added to their shopping bag right from the main home page. When the user clicks on the shopping bag, they're are more features available. It features the items that were added to with the image and name with a 'REMOVE FROM BAG' button to easily remove an unwanted item, displays the total price (active and functional as items may be removed from the bag), a 'CONTINUE SHOPPING' button that routes users back to the main page with items, an 'EMPTY BAG' button that clears the bag, and a 'CHECKOUT' button that pops up a notification that the order has been confirmed. 

_Checkout functionality could later be connected to Stripe's API._
